    The FEC has exclusive jurisdiction over the civil enforcement of the federal campaign finance law. 
    The FEC learns of possible violations through a number of sources including:
  </p>
  <ol class="list--numbered">
    <li>
      <p>Internal referrals, which result from the FEC’s routine review of committee reports and audits of political committees.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Sworn complaints filed with the FEC by anyone alleging that a violation has occurred or is about to occur.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Referrals to the FEC from other government agencies of possible campaign finance violations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Self reported submissions to the FEC by any person or entity that believes it may have  committed a campaign finance violation.</p>

        Coming soon: Generally, the Commission may audit a committee when an internal review of the committee’s reports 
        filed meet thresholds of substantial compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act. Also, the Commission is 
        required to audit all presidential campaigns and convention committees that accept public funds.

    <h4>Matters Under Review (MURs)</h4>
    <p>
      FEC enforcement matters (called MURs) must, by law, remain confidential until they are closed. 
      Law requires the Commission to try to resolve enforcement matters through conciliation.  
      If the Commission fails to reach a conciliation agreement with a respondent, the Commission may choose 
      to pursue the matter in federal court.
