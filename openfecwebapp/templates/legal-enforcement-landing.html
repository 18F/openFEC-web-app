    The FEC exclusively enforces civil federal campaign finance law. Possible
    violations of the law are identified one of four ways:

  <ol class="list--numbered">
    <li>The FEC regularly reviews committee reports and conducts audits.</li>
    <li>Anyone may file a sworn complaint with the FEC that a violation has occurred or is about to occur.</li>
    <li>Other government agencies may refer possible violations to the FEC.</li>
    <li>Any person or entity who believes it has committed a violation may self report to the Commission.</li>

  <h4>Matters Under Review (MURs)</h4>
  <p>
    MURs are standard enforcement cases. By law, the Commission must attempt to
    resolve MURs through a confidential investigative process. If that process
    fails to end with a conciliation agreement, either the Commission or the
    respondent(s) can choose to pursue the matter to court.
